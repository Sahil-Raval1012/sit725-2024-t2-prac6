    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Testing plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and functionality of software. It is a vital component that
        can demonstrate the HD (High Distinction) worthiness of your group project. Pay close attention as we delve
        into the world of testing and its significance in software development.
        Part 1: Take advantage of the provided slides and actively participate in the practical session to gain insights
        into basic testing strategies. This will equip you with essential knowledge and techniques to design and
        implement effective tests for your software.
        Part 2: Continuing from previous weeks, import your weekly project into a new repository. It's time to make
        the necessary modifications and incorporate testing into your project. Implementing tests will help verify the
        correctness of your code, identify potential issues or bugs, and enhance the overall quality of your software.
        By applying testing practices to your project, you can proactively address potential problems, maintain code
        integrity, and ensure the robustness of your application. Embracing testing as an integral part of your software
        development process is a key step towards delivering a high-quality, reliable, and successful project.</p>
